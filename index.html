                        <p>My programming career started off slowly, and was all over the place before I found my footing with the web and Javascript was my weapon of choice. I actually love the language deeply and have been conditioning myself in all aspects of it, from frontend, data handling to backend and in the near future to security. It has been kind to me and also I love how diverse it is, almost natural language like in the way you can solve a particular problem in so so many ways. I see it as a strength of the language, personally because it has allowed me be this good with still a lot more to learn.</p>
